# Multi-Lang Windows Tools

This repository hosts a collection of practical Windows utilities, implemented across multiple programming languages. The tools serve both as useful standalone utilities for Windows users and as educational resources for computer science professors, students, and self-learners aiming to explore different programming languages through real-world examples.

## Available Utilities

1. **Network Snapshot**: Capture and analyze your network traffic.
2. **Largest Files Finder**: Quickly find the 100 largest files on each drive.
3. **System Info**: Gather detailed information about your Windows system.
4. **Duplicate File Finder**: Identify duplicate files and select which ones to keep.

Each utility includes implementations in various programming languages, including:
- Python
- Rust
- C
- C++
- C#
- F#
- Node.js
- Perl
- Go
- D

## Project Motivation

This is a "vibe coding" project crafted with assistance from:
- ChatGPT (GPT-4o1 & GPT-3-mini-high)
- Grok 3
- DeepSeek R1

The utilities are developed exclusively for Windows environments due to testing constraints.

## How to Use

Each utility comes with its own detailed README, providing instructions on building, running, and customizing the software.

## Educational Value

By comparing implementations across multiple languages, users can deepen their understanding of language-specific features, performance considerations, and software design principles.
